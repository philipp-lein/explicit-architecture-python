### ðŸš€ A Django-based project following an explicit architecture.
This project is a simple demonstration of Explicit Architecture in Django. It showcases how to structure a Django application to separate concerns clearly and make the architecture explicit.

## Features
- Add a User via CLI: Add users directly from the command line using a custom management command.
- Database Integration: User data is stored in a database with Djangoâ€™s ORM.
- Explicit Architecture: Focuses on clean code organization, making responsibilities clear and maintainable.
